Tip calculator worksheet for microMathetmatics.

The worksheet is available for download from:

https://github.com/juneyourtech/MM_tipcalculator/releases/

Requirements:

microMathematics Plus 2.17.4 or newer.

The μMath+ app is available from the F-Droid store and app, and from the F-Droid website:

https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.mkulesh.micromath.plus/

Before installation, temporarily allow installing apps from non-Play sources.

μMath+ 2.17.4:
* supports perc() and round() functions, to calculate percentages, and to round numbers, respectively. (Version 2.15.6, which is the most recent to run on Android 2.3, does not have support for these functions.)
* requires Android 4.0 or greater;
* is the most recent to run successfully on my phone with Android 4.1 and just 512 Mb RAM.

I have not tested with the non-Plus version of microMathematics.
