Tip calculator worksheet for microMathetmatics

Requirements:

Micromathematics Plus 2.17.4 or newer.

It's available from the F-Droid store and app.

This version:
* supports perc() and round() functions, to calculate percentages and to round numbers, respectively. (Version 2.15.6, which is the most recent to run on Android 2.3, does not have support for these functions.)
* requires Android 4.0 or greater.
* is the most recent to run successfully on my phone with Android 4.1 and just 512 Mb RAM.

I have not tested with the non-Plus version of microMathematics.

If you're new to this website, but want the tip calculator in microMath Plus, then go to tip_calculator.mmt linked above, and then tap the [Raw] link to see if you can download the file.
